1. app.py it is an simple program for my personal use it just read and data from an file  then process it. saves back to the same file 

For using just download two files(app.py and balance1) run it by typing python  app.py

Unfortunately it will run in linux or MAC  terminal only.  i am trying to get it to an mobile app  or an web app
